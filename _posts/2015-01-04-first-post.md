title: And so it begins
---

This is the first time I've set up a blog, so bear with me. I'm going to be documenting my progress here, you know, stuff I've learnt in Android, Web Development, and what not. That's not all, however. I'll be posting lots of random stuff too, stuff I'm reading now, TV Shows I'm watching, Movies I just saw, and what-not. Maybe even a random quirky tidbit here and there.
After all, this blog _is_ titled "Ramblings of a Stargazer". 
And that is what I am. A dreamer.
