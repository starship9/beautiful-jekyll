title: About me

---

My name is Nishank Saini. I am a computer science undergrad, who's just completed 2 years at Shiv Nadar University, Greater Noida. 


### What do I do, you ask?

Well, I've always been an avid dota player, I follow the scene competitively as well. I do read quite a lot as well, right now, I'm reading George Orwell (fantastic stuff, by the way, do give it a shot). Apart from all that, I watch tons of anime in my free time, and I am a comic buff as well. I spend a ***significant*** amount of time on Reddit, as well as on Quora. 
I am also a staunch believer of the R + L = J theory, but only time will tell if my beliefs are justified.
